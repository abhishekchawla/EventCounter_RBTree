# EventCounter_RBTree
Event counter implemented using Red Black Tree


Final project for my graduate course "Advanced Data Structures". Please read the project pdf for more info.
This project was meant only to demonstrate functioning of RBTree and a use case for it and although the code correctly implements RBTree, it is not exception safe, so use it at your own discretion.
